Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of a subset of the repository's contents that is considered the most important context.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching these patterns are excluded: .github/, examples/apidoc/, docs/images/, docs/endpointFunctionList.md, test/, src/util/, dist/, lib/
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Content has been compressed - code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

# Ed25519 Authentication with Binance APIs in Node.js

## Creating Ed25519 Keys

Officially, binance recommends downloading and running a key generator from their repo. Guidance for this can be found on the [binance website](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/6b9a63f1e3384cf48a2eedb82767a69a) when trying to add a new Ed25519 API key, or in their GitHub repository: https://github.com/binance/asymmetric-key-generator

## Using the Ed25519 public key to get an API key from Binance

Once created, keep your **private key** completely secret! The **public** key needs to be provided to binance when creating new API credentials with the "Self-generated" option.

Your public key should look something like this:

```pem
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
lkn123bx123x+7lkmlkn123bx123xAMDO/lkm123x=
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Submit this in the "Upload public key" form, shown when creating a new API key on binance and choosing the "self-generated" option.

Note: the "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" header & footer can be included.

After using the public key to create a new API key, you will be given an API Key such as the following:

```
mlk2mx3l12m3lxk1m3lxk1m3l1k2mx3l12km3xl1km23x1l2k3mx1l2km3x
```

This is the first piece, used as the "apiKey" in the [rest-private-ed25519.ts](./rest-private-ed25519.ts) example.

## Using the Ed25519 private key for Ed25519 authentication with binance APIs in Node.js

Your private key, if generated with the above steps, should look something like this (but with much more text):

```pem
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
lx1k2m3xl12lkm2l1kmx312312l3mx1lk23m
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

This is your secret, you should **never** share this with anyone, not even binance! Treat this like a password.

As part of this authentication process, your private key is used to generate a signature. This SDK handles this process automatically for you. Ed25519 authentication is automatically detected if the "api_secret" parameter contains the words "PRIVATE KEY", such as the header shown in the example above.

From here, simply use the key provided by binance as the `api_key` parameter and your private key (with the header) as the `api_secret` parameter.

Based on the above example, the following would prepare the main REST client using the above credentials:

```typescript
const ed25519PrivateKey = `
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
lkmlkm123lkms1s12s+lkmlkm123lkms1s12s
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
`;

const ed25519APIKey = 'lkmlkm123lkms1s12slkmlkm123lkms1s12slkmlkm123lkms1s12s';


const client = new MainClient({
  api_key: ed25519APIKey,
  api_secret: ed25519PrivateKey,
  beautifyResponses: true,
});
```

The rest is automatic - just continue using the SDK as you would normally. It will automatically handle signing requests using Ed25519 for you.

For a complete example, refer to the [rest-private-ed25519.ts](./rest-private-ed25519.ts) file on GitHub.

================
File: examples/Auth/rest-private-ed25519.ts
================
import { MainClient } from '../../src/index';
⋮----
// or
// import { MainClient } from 'binance';
⋮----
// Received after creating a new API key with a self-generated RSA public key on binance
⋮----
// The self-generated RSA private key, this is never directly given to binance, but used to generate a signature
// Note: this MUST include the "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY" header so the SDK understands this is RSA auth

# RSA Authentication with Binance APIs in Node.js

## Creating RSA Keys

Officially, binance recommends downloading and running a key generator from their repo. Guidance for this can be found on the binance website when trying to add a new RSA API key.

However, openssl can be used to create the public & private key files using the following steps:

```bash
# Generate a private key with either 2048 or 4096 bit length
openssl genrsa -out rsa-private-key.pem 4096

# Generate a corresponding public key
openssl rsa -in rsa-private-key.pem -pubout -out rsa-public-key.pem
```

## Using the RSA public key to get an API key from Binance

Once created, keep your **private key** completely secret! The **public** key needs to be provided to binance when creating new API credentials with the "Self-generated" option.

Your public key should look something like this:

```pem
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Submit this in the "Upload public key" form, shown when creating a new API key on binance and choosing the "self-generated" option.

Note: the "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" header & footer can be included.

After using the public key to create a new API key, you will be given an API Key such as the following:

```
SIHqWcDeRoj6gkOjLjQh1dnV1CD7IgwQTfL4LVa8wu04zNTYVSmJBIHsjQjgwWqt
```

This is the first piece, used as the "apiKey" in the [rest-private-rsa.ts](./rest-private-rsa.ts) example.

## Using the RSA private key for RSA authentication with binance APIs in Node.js

Your private key, if generated with the above steps, should look something like this (but with much more text):

```pem
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
uayyi6wFTaNeG1/WCqhrowj2kCx8eB6NDZYl+OS9ZI9WC
q/44iFERNuP0TXvQx8tgvSZXyu4/G618QzKh0Ii1uAATt2upa8dp1uGl2U7EqBE8

csB6pxkLLH2qHx05xPBy4PyoB
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

This is your secret, you should never share this with anyone, not even binance! Treat this like a password.

As part of this authentication process, your private key is used to generate a signature (using `RSA-SHA256`). This SDK handles this process automatically for you. RSA authentication is automatically detected if the "api_secret" parameter contains the words "PRIVATE KEY", such as the header shown in the example above.

Note: Binance also supports Ed25519 authentication. If your "secret" matches the following condition, the SDK will revert to to Ed25519 authentication:
- Contains "PRIVATE KEY" as a header
- Does NOT contain "RSA PRIVATE KEY" as a header.

From here, simply use the key provided by binance as the `api_key` parameter and your private key (with the header) as the `api_secret` parameter.

Based on the above example, the following would prepare the main REST client using the above credentials:

```typescript
const api_key = `SIHqWcDeRoj6gkOjLjQh1dnV1CD7IgwQTfL4LVa8wu04zNTYVSmJBIHsjQjgwWqt`;
const rsaPrivateKey = `
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

`;

const client = new MainClient({
  api_key: api_key,
  api_secret: rsaPrivateKey,
  beautifyResponses: true,
});
```

# Binance API - Examples

This folder contains ready to go examples demonstrating various aspects of this API implementation, written in TypeScript (but they are compatible with pure JavaScript projects).

Found something difficult to implement? Contribute to these examples and help others!

## Getting started

- Clone the project (or download it as a zip, or install the module in your own project `npm install binance`).
- Edit the sample as needed (some samples require edits, e.g API keys or import statements to import from npm, not src).
- Execute the sample using tsx: `tsx examples/REST/rest-spot-public.ts`.

Samples that refer to API credentials using `process.env.API_KEY_COM` can be spawned with environment variables. Unix/macOS example:
```
APIKEY='apikeypastedhere' APISECRET='apisecretpastedhere' tsx examples/WebSockets/ws-userdata-listenkey.ts
```

Or edit the example directly to hardcode your API keys.

### WebSockets

All examples relating to WebSockets can be found in the [examples/WebSockets](./WebSockets/) folder. High level summary of available examples:

#### Consumers

These are purely for receiving data from Binance's WebSockets (market data, account updates, etc).

##### Market Data

These examples demonstrate subscribing to & receiving market data from Binance's WebSockets:

- ws-public.ts
  - Demonstration on general usage of the WebSocket client to subscribe to / unsubscribe from one or more market data topics.
- ws-public-spot-orderbook.ts
  - Subscribing to orderbook events for multiple symbols in spot markets.
-	ws-public-spot-trades.ts
  - Subscribing to raw trades for multiple symbols in spot markets.
- ws-unsubscribe.ts
  - Subscribing to a list of topics, and then unsubscribing from a few topics in that list.
- ws-public-usdm-funding.ts
  - Simple example subscribing to a general topic, and how to process incoming events to only extract funding rates from those events.

##### Account Data

These examples demonstrate receiving account update events from Binance's WebSockets:

-	ws-userdata-listenkey.ts
  - Demonstration on subscribing to various user data streams (spot, margin, futures),
  - Handling incoming user data events
  - Using provided type guards to determine which product group the user data event is for (spot, margin, futures, etc).
- ws-userdata-listenKey-testnet.ts
  - Similar to above, but on testnet.
- ws-userdata-connection-safety.ts
  - Demonstration on extra safety around the first user data stream connection.
  - Note: this is overkill in most situations...

##### WebSocket API

These examples demonstrate how to send commands using Binance's WebSocket API (e.g. submitting orders). Very similar to the REST API, but using a persisted WebSocket connection instead of HTTP requests.

- ws-api-client.ts
  - Demonstration of using Binance's WebSocket API in Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript, using the WebsocketAPIClient.
  - This WebsocketAPIClient is very similar to a REST client, with one method per available command (endpoint) and fully typed requests & responses.
  - Routing is automatically handled via the WebsocketClient, including authentication and connection persistence. Just call the functions you need - the SDK does the rest.
  - From a usage perspective, it feels like a REST API - you can await responses just like a HTTP request.
- ws-api-raw-promises.ts
  - More verbose usage of the WebSocket API using the `sendWSAPIRequest()` method.
  - The `WebsocketAPIClient` uses this method too, so in most cases it is simple to just use the `WebsocketAPIClient` instead.
- ws-userdata-wsapi.ts
  - The listenKey workflow for the user data stream is deprecated (in spot markets).
  - This example demonstrates how to subscribe to the user data stream in spot markets, without a listen key, using the WebSocket API.

##### Misc Workflows

These are miscellaneous examples that cover one or more of the above categories:

- ws-close.ts
  - Closing the (old listen-key driven) user data stream.
  - Unsubscribing from various topics.
- ws-proxy-socks.ts
  - Using WebSockets over a SOCKS proxy.
- deprecated-ws-public.ts


### REST APIs

All examples relating to REST APIs can be found in the [examples/REST](./REST/) folder. Most examples are named around functionality & product group. Any examples with "private" involve API calls relating to your account (such as changing settings or submitting orders, etc),

High level summary for some of the available examples, but check the folder for a complete list:

#### REST USDM Examples

- `rest-future-bracket-order.ts` Creates three order, entry, TP, SL and submit them all at once using `submitMultipleOrders`
- `rest-usdm-order.ts` Creates single entry, using `submitNewOrder`
- `rest-usdm-order-sl.ts` Modify current Stop Loss order(HedgeMode only)

# Binance API

## 2.0.14
- Update values thrown by exception parser.

## 2.0.13
- Expose time sync offset getter/setter in base client. `getTimeOffset()/setTimeOffest(value)`.
- Add handler to signMessage method, falling back to browser equivalent if method is not a function (react/preact/#141).

## 2.0.12
- Increase default timeout for websocket pong heartbeats to 7500ms.

## 2.0.11
- Fix APIs that use the DELETE method.

## 2.0.9-10
- Fix typo in websocket types.
- Fix missing type properties for ws messages.

## 2.0.8
- Emit `reconnected` events for reconnected user data stream.

## 2.0.6
- Fix symbol & margin asset types for futures user data updated position event.

## 2.0.5
- Refine types for user data websocket events (futures)

## 2.0.4
- Disable 'silly' logger category by default to reduce ping/pong noise.
- Expand ws support to other API categories.
- Expand beautifier support for other WS messages.

## 2.0.3
- Expand main-client APIs.
- Expand usdm-client APIs.

## 2.0.2
- Fix getAccountInformation main endpoint.
- Fix a few missing APIs.
- Refactor SpotClient->MainClient. SpotClient will be deprecated in future (MainClient is the same, just a different name).
- Fix build errors from incorrect module imports.

## 2.0.0

- Introduction for typescript with strong types on most request parameters & responses.
  - NPM package includes transpiled framework & type declarations.
  - Supports both typescript and vanilla node.js projects.
  - REST requests and responses include detailed types, though some may still be missing.
  - Raw and beautified WS events include detailed types, though some may still be missing.
- Introduction for webpack.
  - To generate a browser bundle clone & build the library then run webpack using `npm run pack`.
- Introduction for integration tests via jest on all REST clients.
  - Tests are executed automatically to avoid unintended breaking changes on release.
  - Real API calls are made to validate integration.
- Complete networking overhaul using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
  - Small & modern framework. Significant reduction in dependencies via deprecation of `request`.
  - Support for proxies and [other axios-supported functionality](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config).
  - Support for backend (node) and frontend (browser) requests.
- Complete overhaul in websockets client.
  - Websocket events are still (optionally) beautified consistently with how the previous library worked.
  - New event-driven architecture.
  - Support for USDM Futures. More to come in a future release.
  - Automatic connection monitoring, with automatic reconnect if the connection goes stale.
  - Automatic userData connection monitoring, with automatic refresh and respawn if previous listen key expires or the connection closes unexpectedly.
- Complete overhaul in REST client.
  - Revamped spot client (see [spot-client](./src/spot-client.ts)).
  - Introduction of [usdm-client](./src/usdm-client.ts) for USDM Futures.
- Passive tracking & storage of API limit states (IP request weight & order weight).
  - Parsed automatically via response headers when any request is made, if header is detected.
  - See `getRateLimitStates()` to query the last seen weights on any of the REST clients.
- Smarter time-sync to handle common recvWindow latency issues (optional, default on).

### 2.0.0-beta.4

- Breaking change: refactor most options to camel case (instead of underscore separation).
- Add optional beautifier support for REST responses (parses known numbers stored as strings into numbers).

### 2.0.0-beta.5-8

- Breaking change: refactor spot getAllCoinsInformation to getBalances().
- Fix POST request format to www-form-urlencoded.

<!-- ## 2.0.1 -->
  <!-- - Introduction of [coinm-client](./src/coinm-client.ts) for COINM Futures. -->
  <!-- - Introduction of [vanilla-client](./src/vanilla-client.ts) for Vanilla Options. -->

# User Data Streams - Binance

The user data streams are the WebSocket method for asynchronously receiving events when any changes happen on your account. Including but not limited to:
- order events (filled/cancelled/updated/etc)
- position events
- balance events (deposit/withdraw/etc)
- misc events (leverage changed, position mode changed, etc)

## Mechanisms

There are currently two key mechanisms for subscribing to user data events

### Mechanisms - Listen Key

The older and original mechanism involves a listen key. This is requested via the REST API and then used when opening a connection to the user data stream.

The listen key can expire and needs a regular "ping" (a REST API call) to keep it alive.

With the "binance" Node.js & JavaScript SDK, you can easily subscribe to the user data stream via the listen key workflow, through just one function call.

The SDK will automatically:
- fetch a listen key
- perform regular keep alive requests on the listen key
- handle listen key expiry/refresh
- handle reconnects, if a connection is temporarily lost

All you have to do is ask for the user data stream and process incoming events - the SDK will handle the rest!

For a working example, refer to the [ws-userdata-listenkey](./ws-userdata-listenkey.ts) example.

**Deprecation warning: As of April 2025, the listen key workflow is also deprecated for Spot markets (no known ETA for removal).** Refer to the changelog for details: https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/CHANGELOG#2025-04-07

### Mechanisms - WS API User Data Stream

The newer mechanism for the user data stream is via an active WebSocket API connection. This is a simpler mechanism in that it does not require a listen key. You can easily use this new mechanism via the WebsocketClient (or WebsocketAPIClient) within this SDK.

For a working example, refer to the [ws-userdata-wsapi](./ws-userdata-wsapi.ts) example.

Updated & performant JavaScript & Node.js SDK for the Binance REST APIs and WebSockets:

- Professional, robust & performant Binance SDK with leading trading volume in production (livenet).
- Extensive integration with Binance REST APIs, WebSockets & WebSocket APIs.
- Complete TypeScript support (with type declarations for all API requests & responses).
- Supports Binance REST APIs for Binance Spot, Margin, Isolated Margin, Options, USDM & CoinM Futures.
  - Strongly typed requests and responses.
  - Automated end-to-end tests on most API calls, ensuring no breaking changes are released to npm.
- Actively maintained with a modern, promise-driven interface.
- Support for all authentication mechanisms available on Binance:
  - HMAC
  - RSA
  - Ed25519 (required for WS API).
  - Passing a private key as a secret will automatically detect whether to switch to RSA or Ed25519 authentication.
- Supports WebSockets for all available product groups on Binance including Spot, Margin, Isolated Margin, Portfolio, Options, USDM & CoinM Futures.
  - Event driven messaging.
  - Smart WebSocket persistence
    - Automatically handle silent WebSocket disconnections through timed heartbeats, including the scheduled 24hr disconnect.
    - Automatically handle listenKey persistence and expiration/refresh.
    - Emit `reconnected` event when dropped connection is restored.
  - Strongly typed on most WebSocket events, with typeguards available for TypeScript users.
  - Optional:
    - Automatic beautification of WebSocket events (from one-letter keys to descriptive words, and strings with floats to numbers).
    - Automatic beautification of REST responses (parsing numbers in strings to numbers).
- Supports WebSocket API on all available product groups, including Spot & Futures:
  - Use the WebsocketClient's event-driven `sendWSAPIRequest()` method, or;
  - Use the WebsocketAPIClient for a REST-like experience. Use the WebSocket API like a REST API! See [examples/ws-api-client.ts](./examples/ws-api-client.ts) for a demonstration.
- Heavy automated end-to-end testing with real API calls.
  - End-to-end testing before any release.
  - Real API calls in e2e tests.
- Proxy support via axios integration.
- Active community support & collaboration in telegram: [Node.js Algo Traders](https://t.me/nodetraders).

# Usage

Create API credentials at Binance

- [Livenet](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072?ref=IVRLUZJO)
- [Testnet](https://testnet.binance.vision/).
- [Testnet Futures](testnet.binancefuture.com).
- [Demo Trading](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-test-my-functions-on-binance-spot-test-network-ab78f9a1b8824cf0a106b4229c76496d) - Uses real market data with simulated trading.

### Demo Trading vs Testnet

Binance offers two testing environments:

- **Demo Trading**: Uses real market data but simulated trading. This is ideal for testing strategies since market conditions match production. Available for Spot, USD-M Futures, and COIN-M Futures.
- **Testnet**: Separate environment with simulated market data. Market conditions are very different from real markets and not recommended for strategy testing.

To use demo trading, simply set `demoTrading: true` in the client options. See the [demo trading examples](./examples/REST/rest-spot-demo.ts) for more information.

## REST API Clients

There are several REST API modules as there are some differences in each API group.

1. `MainClient` for most APIs, including: spot, margin, isolated margin, mining, BLVT, BSwap, Fiat & sub-account management.
2. `USDMClient` for USD-M futures APIs.
3. `CoinMClient` for COIN-M futures APIs.
4. `PortfolioClient` for Portfolio Margin APIs.

Vanilla Options is not yet available. Please get in touch if you're looking for this.

### REST Main Client

The MainClient covers all endpoints under the main "api\*.binance.com" subdomains, including but not limited to endpoints in the following product groups:

- Spot
- Cross & isolated margin
- Convert
- Wallet
- Futures management (transfers & history)
- Sub account management
- Misc transfers
- Auto & dual invest
- Staking
- Mining
- Loans & VIP loans
- Simple Earn
- NFTs
- C2C
- Exchange Link
- Alpha trading

Refer to the following links for a complete list of available endpoints:

- [Binance Node.js & JavaScript SDK Endpoint Map](https://github.com/tiagosiebler/binance/blob/master/docs/endpointFunctionList.md)
- [Binance Spot API Docs](https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/rest-api/general-endpoints)

Start by importing the `MainClient` class. API credentials are optional, unless you plan on making private API calls. More Node.js & JavaScript examples for Binance's REST APIs & WebSockets can be found in the [examples](./examples) folder on GitHub.

```javascript
import { MainClient } from 'binance';

// or, if you prefer `require()`:
// const { MainClient } = require('binance');

const API_KEY = 'xxx';
const API_SECRET = 'yyy';

const client = new MainClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  // Connect to testnet environment
  // testnet: true,
});

client
  .getAccountTradeList({ symbol: 'BTCUSDT' })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('getAccountTradeList result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('getAccountTradeList error: ', err);
  });

client
  .getExchangeInfo()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('getExchangeInfo inverse result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('getExchangeInfo inverse error: ', err);
  });
```

See [main-client.ts](./src/main-client.ts) for further information on the available REST API endpoints for spot/margin/etc.

### REST USD-M Futures

Start by importing the USDM client. API credentials are optional, unless you plan on making private API calls.

```javascript
import { USDMClient } from 'binance';

// or, if you prefer `require()`:
// const { USDMClient } = require('binance');

const API_KEY = 'xxx';
const API_SECRET = 'yyy';

const client = new USDMClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  // Connect to testnet environment
  // testnet: true,
});

client
  .getBalance()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('getBalance result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('getBalance error: ', err);
  });

client
  .submitNewOrder({
    side: 'SELL',
    symbol: 'BTCUSDT',
    type: 'MARKET',
    quantity: 0.001,
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('submitNewOrder result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('submitNewOrder error: ', err);
  });
```

See [usdm-client.ts](./src/usdm-client.ts) for further information.

### REST COIN-M Futures

Start by importing the coin-m client. API credentials are optional, though an error is thrown when attempting any private API calls without credentials.

```javascript
import { CoinMClient } from 'binance';

// or, if you prefer `require()`:
// const { CoinMClient } = require('binance');

const API_KEY = 'xxx';
const API_SECRET = 'yyy';

const client = new CoinMClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  // Connect to testnet environment
  // testnet: true,
});

client
  .getSymbolOrderBookTicker()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('getSymbolOrderBookTicker result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('getSymbolOrderBookTicker error: ', err);
  });
```

See [coinm-client.ts](./src/coinm-client.ts) for further information.

### REST Portfolio Margin

Start by importing the Portfolio client. API credentials are optional, though an error is thrown when attempting any private API calls without credentials.

```javascript
import { PortfolioClient } from 'binance';

// or, if you prefer `require()`:
// const { PortfolioClient } = require('binance');

const API_KEY = 'xxx';
const API_SECRET = 'yyy';

const client = new PortfolioClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  // Connect to testnet environment
  // testnet: true,
});

client
  .getBalance()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('getBalance result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('getBalance error: ', err);
  });

client
  .submitNewUMOrder({
    side: 'SELL',
    symbol: 'BTCUSDT',
    type: 'MARKET',
    quantity: 0.001,
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('submitNewUMOrder result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('submitNewUMOrder error: ', err);
  });
```

See [portfolio-client.ts](./src/portfolio-client.ts) for further information.

## WebSockets

### WebSocket Consumers

All websockets are accessible via the shared `WebsocketClient`. As before, API credentials are optional unless the user data stream is required.

The below example demonstrates connecting as a consumer, to receive WebSocket events from Binance:

```javascript
import { WebsocketClient } from 'binance';

// or, if you prefer `require()`:
// const { WebsocketClient } = require('binance');

const API_KEY = 'xxx';
const API_SECRET = 'yyy';

/**
 * The WebsocketClient will manage individual connections for you, under the hood.
 * Just make an instance of the WS Client and subscribe to topics. It'll handle the rest.
 */
const wsClient = new WebsocketClient({
  api_key: key,
  api_secret: secret,
  // Optional: when enabled, the SDK will try to format incoming data into more readable objects.
  // Beautified data is emitted via the "formattedMessage" event
  beautify: true,
  // Disable ping/pong ws heartbeat mechanism (not recommended)
  // disableHeartbeat: true,
  // Connect to testnet environment
  // testnet: true,
});

// receive raw events
wsClient.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('raw message received ', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
});

// notification when a connection is opened
wsClient.on('open', (data) => {
  console.log('connection opened open:', data.wsKey, data.wsUrl);
});

// receive formatted events with beautified keys. Any "known" floats stored in strings as parsed as floats.
wsClient.on('formattedMessage', (data) => {
  console.log('formattedMessage: ', data);
});

// read response to command sent via WS stream (e.g LIST_SUBSCRIPTIONS)
wsClient.on('response', (data) => {
  console.log('log response: ', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
});

// receive notification when a ws connection is reconnecting automatically
wsClient.on('reconnecting', (data) => {
  console.log('ws automatically reconnecting.... ', data?.wsKey);
});

// receive notification that a reconnection completed successfully (e.g use REST to check for missing data)
wsClient.on('reconnected', (data) => {
  console.log('ws has reconnected ', data?.wsKey);
});

// Recommended: receive error events (e.g. first reconnection failed)
wsClient.on('exception', (data) => {
  console.log('ws saw error ', data?.wsKey);
});

/**
 * Subscribe to public topics either one at a time or many in an array
 */

// E.g. one at a time, routed to the coinm futures websockets:
wsClient.subscribe('btcusd@indexPrice', 'coinm');
wsClient.subscribe('btcusd@miniTicker', 'coinm');

// Or send many topics at once to a stream, e.g. the usdm futures stream:
wsClient.subscribe(
  ['btcusdt@aggTrade', 'btcusdt@markPrice', '!miniTicker@arr'],
  'usdm',
);

// spot & margin topics should go to "main"
// (similar how the MainClient is for REST APIs in that product group)
wsClient.subscribe(
  [
    // All Market Rolling Window Statistics Streams
    // https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/web-socket-streams#all-market-rolling-window-statistics-streams
    '!ticker_1h@arr',
    // Individual Symbol Book Ticker Streams
    // https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/web-socket-streams#individual-symbol-book-ticker-streams

#### Preserving large integers in WebSocket messages

By default, messages are parsed using `JSON.parse`, which cannot precisely represent integers larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.
If you need to preserve large integers (e.g., order IDs), provide a custom parser via `customParseJSONFn`.

Example using RegEx below, although alternatives are possible too if desired. For more exampes check [ws-custom-parser.ts](./examples/WebSockets/ws-custom-parser.ts) in the examples folder:

```ts
import { WebsocketClient } from 'binance';

/**
 * ETHUSDT in futures can have unusually large orderId values, sent as numbers. See this thread for more details:
 * https://github.com/tiagosiebler/binance/issues/208
 *
 * If this is a problem for you, you can set a custom JSON parsing alternative using the customParseJSONFn hook injected into the WebsocketClient's constructor, as below:
 */
const ws = new WebsocketClient({
  // Default behaviour, if you don't include this:
  // customParseJSONFn: (rawEvent) => {
  //   return JSON.parse(rawEvent);
  // },

  // Or, pre-process the raw event using RegEx, before using the same workflow:
  customParseJSONFn: (rawEvent) => {
    return JSON.parse(
      rawEvent.replace(/"orderId":\s*(\d+)/g, '"orderId":"$1"'),
    );
  },

  // Or, use a 3rd party library such as json-bigint:
  // customParseJSONFn: (rawEvent) => {
  //   return JSONbig({ storeAsString: true }).parse(rawEvent);
  // },
});

ws.on('message', (msg) => {
  console.log(msg);
});

// If you prefer native BigInt, beware JSON.stringify will throw on BigInt values.
// Use a custom replacer or JSONbig.stringify if you need to log/serialize:
// const replacer = (_k: string, v: unknown) => typeof v === 'bigint' ? v.toString() : v;
// console.log(JSON.stringify(msg, replacer));
```

### WebSocket API

Some of the product groups available on Binance also support sending requests (commands) over an active WebSocket connection. This is called the WebSocket API.

Note: the WebSocket API requires the use of Ed25519 keys. HMAC & RSA keys are not supported by Binance for the WebSocket API (as of Apr 2025).

#### Event Driven API

The WebSocket API is available in the [WebsocketClient](./src/websocket-client.ts) via the `sendWSAPIRequest(wsKey, command, commandParameters)` method.

Each call to this method is wrapped in a promise, which you can async await for a response, or handle it in a raw event-driven design.

#### Async Await API

The WebSocket API is also available in a promise-wrapped REST-like format. Either, as above, await any calls to `sendWSAPIRequest(...)`, or directly use the convenient WebsocketAPIClient. This class is very similar to existing REST API classes (such as the MainClient or USDMClient).

It provides one function per endpoint, feels like a REST API and will automatically route your request via an automatically persisted, authenticated and health-checked WebSocket API connection.

Below is an example showing how easy it is to use the WebSocket API without any concern for the complexity of managing WebSockets.

```typescript
import { WebsocketAPIClient } from 'binance';

// or, if you prefer `require()`:
// const { WebsocketAPIClient } = require('binance');

/**
 * The WS API only works with an Ed25519 API key.
 *
 * Check the rest-private-ed25519.md in this folder for more guidance
 * on preparing this Ed25519 API key.
 */

const publicKey = `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MCexampleQTxwLU9o=
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
`;

const privateKey = `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MC4CAQAexamplewqj5CzUuTy1
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
`;

// API Key returned by binance, generated using the publicKey (above) via Binance's website
const apiKey = 'TQpJexamplerobdG';

// Make an instance of the WS API Client
const wsClient = new WebsocketAPIClient({
  api_key: apiKey,
  api_secret: privateKey,
  beautify: true,

  // Enforce testnet ws connections, regardless of supplied wsKey
  // testnet: true,
});

// Optional, if you see RECV Window errors, you can use this to manage time issues. However, make sure you sync your system clock first!
// https://github.com/tiagosiebler/awesome-crypto-examples/wiki/Timestamp-for-this-request-is-outside-of-the-recvWindow
// wsClient.setTimeOffsetMs(-5000);

// Optional, see above. Can be used to prepare a connection before sending commands
// await wsClient.connectWSAPI(WS_KEY_MAP.mainWSAPI);

// Make WebSocket API calls, very similar to a REST API:

wsClient
  .getFuturesAccountBalanceV2({
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    recvWindow: 5000,
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('getFuturesAccountBalanceV2 result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('getFuturesAccountBalanceV2 error: ', err);
  });

wsClient
  .submitNewFuturesOrder('usdm', {
    side: 'SELL',
    symbol: 'BTCUSDT',
    type: 'MARKET',
    quantity: 0.001,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    // recvWindow: 5000,
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('getFuturesAccountBalanceV2 result: ', result);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('getFuturesAccountBalanceV2 error: ', err);
  });
```

## Market Maker Endpoints

Binance provides specialized market maker endpoints for qualified high-frequency trading users who have enrolled in at least one of the Futures Liquidity Provider Programs, including the USDⓈ-M Futures Maker Program, COIN-M Futures Maker Program, and USDⓈ-M Futures Taker Program.

These endpoints provide the same functionality as regular endpoints but with optimized routing for market makers. For more information about eligibility and enrollment, visit: https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/7df7f3838c3b49e692d175374c3a3283

### Using Market Maker Endpoints

To use market maker endpoints, simply add the `useMMSubdomain: true` option when initializing any client (REST API clients, WebSocket clients, or WebSocket API clients):

#### Market Maker REST API Clients

```javascript
import { USDMClient, CoinMClient } from 'binance';

// USD-M Futures with MM endpoints
const usdmClient = new USDMClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  useMMSubdomain: true, // Enable market maker endpoints
});

// COIN-M Futures with MM endpoints
const coinmClient = new CoinMClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  useMMSubdomain: true, // Enable market maker endpoints
});
```

#### Market Maker WebSocket Clients

```javascript
import { WebsocketClient, WebsocketAPIClient } from 'binance';

// WebSocket consumer with MM endpoints
const wsClient = new WebsocketClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  useMMSubdomain: true, // Enable market maker endpoints
});

// WebSocket API client with MM endpoints
const wsApiClient = new WebsocketAPIClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  useMMSubdomain: true, // Enable market maker endpoints
});
```

**Note:** Market maker endpoints are only available for futures products (USD-M and COIN-M). Spot, margin, and other product groups use the regular endpoints regardless of the `useMMSubdomain` setting. Market maker endpoints are also not available on testnet environments.

### Best practice

Since market maker endpoints are only available for some of the futures endpoints, you may need to use multiple client instances if your algorithm needs to use both regular and MM endpoints.

```javascript
import { USDMClient } from 'binance';

// MM client for USD-M futures
const futuresMMClient = new USDMClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  useMMEndpoints: true, // Use MM endpoints for futures
});

// Regular client for USD-M futures
const futuresRegularClient = new USDMClient({
  api_key: API_KEY,
  api_secret: API_SECRET,
  useMMEndpoints: false, // Use regular endpoints for futures
});
```

## Customise Logging

Pass a custom logger which supports the log methods `trace`, `info` and `error`, or override methods from the default logger as desired.

```javascript
import { WebsocketClient, DefaultLogger } from 'binance';

// or, if you prefer `require()`:
// const { WebsocketClient, DefaultLogger } = require('binance');

// Enable all logging on the trace level (disabled by default)
DefaultLogger.trace = (...params) => {
  console.trace('trace: ', params);
};

// Pass the updated logger as the 2nd parameter
const ws = new WebsocketClient(
  {
    api_key: key,
    api_secret: secret,
    beautify: true,
  },
  DefaultLogger
);

// Or, create a completely custom logger with the 3 available functions
const customLogger = {
  trace: (...params: LogParams): void => {
    console.trace(new Date(), params);
  },
  info: (...params: LogParams): void => {
    console.info(new Date(), params);
  },
  error: (...params: LogParams): void => {
    console.error(new Date(), params);
  },
}

// Pass the custom logger as the 2nd parameter
const ws = new WebsocketClient(
  {
    api_key: key,
    api_secret: secret,
    beautify: true,
  },
  customLogger
);
```

## Browser/Frontend Usage

### Import

This is the "modern" way, allowing the package to be directly imported into frontend projects with full typescript support.

1. Install these dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install crypto-browserify stream-browserify
   ```
2. Add this to your `tsconfig.json`
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "paths": {
         "crypto": [
           "./node_modules/crypto-browserify"
         ],
         "stream": [
           "./node_modules/stream-browserify"
         ]
   }
   ```
3. Declare this in the global context of your application (ex: in polyfills for angular)
   ```js
   (window as any).global = window;
   ```

### Webpack

This is the "old" way of using this package on webpages. This will build a minified js bundle that can be pulled in using a script tag on a website.

Build a bundle using webpack:

- `npm install`
- `npm build`
- `npm pack`

The bundle can be found in `dist/`. Altough usage should be largely consistent, smaller differences will exist. Documentation is still TODO.

## Use with LLMs & AI

This SDK includes a bundled `llms.txt` file in the root of the repository. If you're developing with LLMs, use the included `llms.txt` with your LLM - it will significantly improve the LLMs understanding of how to correctly use this SDK.

This file contains AI optimised structure of all the functions in this package, and their parameters for easier use with any learning models or artificial intelligence.
